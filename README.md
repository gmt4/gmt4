Hey! I'm [@gmt4](https://twitter.com/gmt4) 👋

I'm a software developer from EU 🇪🇺. 

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to open source projects. At the same time, I'm also helping a limited number of teams and organizations as an external consultant. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to contact me. 🤓

If my open source projects are useful for your product/company you can also sponsor my work on them. 
☕

You can find me on:

- My website: [gmt4.github.io](gmt4.github.io)
- GitHub as [@gmt4](https://twitter.com/gmt4) (you are here)
